This program acts as a bridge between Community Core Vision (CCV) and your Client via **socket.io**

#### How it works?

1. Connects to OSC server where CCV is emitting
2. Translates OSC information into a more usable JSON format
3. Sends the stream of data to your client via socket.io

####Â How to use it?
1. Open CCV and leave it Open (it will start emitting data immediately)
2. Run `npm run start` on CCV-Bridge's folder
3. Now you can connect as many clients as you need to it and read the stream of data

>You can leave CCV and CCV-Bridge side by side to see the stream of data in relationship to the video

#### Notes

- You can run `npm run start:osc` to see the stream of data in OSC raw format
- You can run `npm dev` to run the app in watch mode when developing over it (it will restart itself with every change).
